# Each activity aj has a sart time sj and a finish time fj
# We receive in input an array of activites and need to select
# the max activities which doesn't overlap that is, given activity
# ai and aj: sj >= fi or si >= fj
#
# We also know that the finish time of activities is stored in monotically
# increasing order.
#
# We need to find the maximum-size subset of mutually compatible activities.
#
# This can be achieved with DP but a better solution is to use a greedy_algoritm (check the related folder)
